\section{Introduction}
%indent present can be removed with \noindent,
%or can be changed with \bigskip or \smallskip
It is important to note that there is a significant difference between
the terms “hazard” and “risk”. According to Codex Alimentarius, a
food safety “hazard” is explained as “a biological, chemical or
physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an
adverse health effect” and a food safety “risk” is described as “a
function of the probability of an adverse health effect and the
severity of that effect, consequential to a hazard(s) in food"
