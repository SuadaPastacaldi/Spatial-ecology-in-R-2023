# how species are related to each other in time
#multivariate analysis 
#rescale all data in just two dimentions 

# with vegan package, vegetation analysis
library(vegan)
# ordination methods (ordinate em in space-->multivariate analysis)


# dataset called dune, vegetation on them
#recall data

data("dune")
dune #shows data

# or use head function, shows only first 6 rows
head(dune)

#or use tail function


####MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
#decorana function, detrended correspondence analysis
#other methods, pc,correspondence analysis...

#4 axis, we use two to scale the whole data, ex first two
#measure lenght of pc1 ( so the percentage of data that it covers)
